This is the repository for the web app to connect to the MOL-Server.

## Features
This web app allows a user to connect to a (configurable) MOL-backend and perform common operations, such as:

- Authentication actions (Logging in, Signing up, Logging out)
- Viewing, creating, updating and deleting law-resources (books, entries, sections) you have access to
- Managing members of law-books by sending out invitations and setting permissions
- Interacting with other users by being invited to a foreign law-book
